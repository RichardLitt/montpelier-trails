> Interactive map of trails in Montpelier, VT

## Background

I wanted a map of interactive trails in Montpelier. This repo is my attempt to get that.

### Goals

1. Get a list of trails from an online API (possibly via scraping a website?)
2. Show this on an OpenStreetMaps map
3. Load up a little node server, to show it on a website
4. Host on Heroku? Maybe GitHub pages.

## Install

Clone the repo and run `node index.js`. There's nothing exported at the moment.

## Usage

`node index.js`

### Tests

To run the tests, run `npm run tests`.
